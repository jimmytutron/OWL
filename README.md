# Overwatch Reddit Scraper :ok_hand:

A fullstack web app that scrapes posts and links from the Overwatch subreddit and lets users save and add notes to posts. This app uses handlebars for html rendering, node and express for server, and mongoDB as the database. MEHN stack? Is that a thing? Well it is now.

## Getting Started :floppy_disk:

### Prerequisites :open_file_folder:

### mongoDB :herb:
In order for the app to render locally, you will need to have mongoDB installed on your computer. Depending on your operating system, the installation proccess will be different. You can find more info on installing mongoDB through their documentation.

The deployed version of this app is hosted on heroku [here](https://young-ocean-94203.herokuapp.com/)

To view this app locally on your machine type `node server.js` into your terminal to intialize the app. This will set up a local server on your computer. Navigate to the server in your browser by visiting `http://localhost:3000/`

To end the sever connection simply hold down `ctrl + c` inside of your terminal.
